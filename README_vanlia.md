This Github Action helps you build kernels. It reads multiple kernel sources from a configuration file and builds them using different toolchains. Additionally, it supports patching the kernel with KernelSU and uploading the built kernel image.

# Github Action

This action contains two jobs: `Set-repos` and `Build-Kernel`.

The `Set-repos` job reads the kernel sources from the configuration file and outputs them to the `Build-Kernel` job. The `Build-Kernel` job uses the outputted kernel sources to build the kernels and upload the built kernel images.

# Configuration File Syntax

See [repo configuration file guidance](./repos/README.md).

# How to use

This project's basic usage is as follows:

1. Fork this project on GitHub.

2. Modify the `repos/repos*.json` file through the Github website or pull it to your local machine and commit the changes.

3. Go to the `Action` page on Github and find `Build kernels`, then `Run workflow`.

4. Wait for the compilation to finish, then download the compiled product from the corresponding page.

5. Use your preferred packaging software to package the kernel ([AnyKernel3](https://github.com/osm0sis/AnyKernel3), [Android-Image-Kitchen](https://github.com/osm0sis/Android-Image-Kitchen), [MagiskBoot](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases), etc.)

# Local testing

If you don't want to run the action on `Github`, you can use [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test this workflow locally and output the files.

## Normal local build (kernel source code is fetched using Git)

This is the recommended local testing process. Simply install [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) and run the following command:

```sh
# Collect artifacts to /tmp/artifacts folder:
act --artifact-server-path /tmp/artifacts
```

If you want to store the artifacts in a different location, change `/tmp/artifacts` to your preferred directory.

If there are errors, use the `-v` flag to generate an error report and submit an issue. Here's the command:

```sh
# Collect artifacts to /tmp/artifacts folder:
act --artifact-server-path /tmp/artifacts -v
```

## Full local build (kernel source code is stored locally)

If you need to perform a completely local build, consider building as follows:

1. Set up a local `Gitea` or `Gitlab` Git service and modify the configuration file address to point to the local service address.

2. Use `git daemon` to create a secondary image locally.

This is just a suggestion, and we do not provide a specific guide.

# TODO list

- Use `MagiskBoot` to generate `boot.img`
- Web page for configuring profiles
